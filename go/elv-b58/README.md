# elv-b58

elv-b58 makes a small wrapper around [ms-tron/base58](https://github.com/mr-tron/base58) and exposes it as a shared library that can be used through native bindings from other languages (e.g. from java) - as in project [elv-tokens-java](https://github.com/eluv-io/elv-tokens/blob/main/java).
